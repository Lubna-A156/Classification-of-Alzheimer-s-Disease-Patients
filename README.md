Objective:
Developing a machine learning model to classify Alzheimerâ€™s patients based on disease type, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.

Methodology:
Collected and preprocessed patient data, handling missing values and normalizing data using MinMaxScaler.
Applied feature encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical values.
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification.
Evaluated model performance using Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and Accuracy Score to assess precision, recall, and overall accuracy.

Outcome:
Successfully classified patients with high accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of machine learning in medical diagnostics.
